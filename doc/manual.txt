Introduction

This extension was initially developed by Reinhard Führicht for Typoheads (www.typoheads.at). After the initial upload to Forge, the development team got enriched by Fabien Udriot and Johannes Feustel. If you want to participate, report bugs or demand additional features please use the possibilities of Forge (forge.typo3.org).
If you like this extension and want to encourage development of new features, feel free to write an email to office(at) typoheads.at to receive details about donation process.
What does it do?
When you reach the limits of the standard mailform functionality of TYPO3 (especially when you want the form to look special) you can use this extension to use your conventional HTML-forms (as HTML-snippets) with full mailform functionality.
This extension is considered as the follow-up to th_mailformplus, including nearly all the features of th_mailformplus and many more new features having a completely new architecture and code. The result is a very flexible approach to form handling.
The new architecture and TypoScript configuration makes it possible to easily control the processing of the form by adding an infinite number of validators and interceptors to filter form input. After successful form submission you can add special interceptors to sanitize input values for final processing in the so called “finishers”. Finishers are used to save data into DB, send emails, redirect to another page, etc. Have a look at the available classes described in this manual. If you miss a feature, you can easily write your own class and plug it into MailformPlus MVC processing. After having read the manual and looked into the code documentation, you will see how your own classes can be integrated into MailformPlus MVC.

Please visit the extension's section on forge to post feature requests or report bugs.
http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-formhandler

Note: This extension requires PHP 5.2 or higher.

Goals

This extension's architecture is designed to be as modular as possible making it easy to perform changes and add new features. As every form needs different configuration than another form, there are many different “blocks” which can be stuck together fulfilling almost all needs.

Comparison to th_mailformplus

Formhandler is considered a follow-up to th_mailformplus. th_mailformplus has started with a very basic feature set and has grown to a huge extension over the years. The code got kind of unmaintainable and it was time to change the architecture to be quicker spotting and fixing bugs and to offer a whole new experience of flexibility. For a guide on how to upgrade TypoScript configuration from th_mailformplus to Formhandler have a look at the section “How to upgrade  from th_mailformplus to Formhandler”.
First of all Formhandler has a more up-to-date architecture, which allows a more modular approach having different classes for different tasks. Another advantage of this architecture is a smaller code base making updates and adding of additional features much less time consuming.
Compared to th_mailformplus Formhandler offers much more flexibility. The modular approach allows the user to add an infinite number of either predefined or self written classes to processing (PreProcessors, Interceptors, Validators, Finishers). When you are not satisfied with the features Formhandler has to offer, you can easily write your own class and add it to the rendering process without changing a single line in the PHP code of Formhandler. 
Have a look at the section “How does this extension work?” and the TypoScript configuration options. For a more practical way of explanation, have a look at the “How to ...” sections at the end of the manual or the folder “Examples” in the extension directory.

This is how Formhandler works. Quite simple, isn't it? For more information about the rendering process have a look at the section “How does this extension work?”.


The Plugin view of Formhandler. The user can choose a template file and a translation file. Furthermore the user can enter settings for E-mail submission and redirection.

Users manual
Create template
To create a form using Formhandler you will first have to write a HTML template file containing the code of your form. You will have to follow certain rules, so that Formhandler will be able to detect the suitable subparts for each situation. For an overview of how to create a form template have a look at the sections “How to set up a simple form” and “Available markers to use in subparts” or check the demo templates located at EXT:formhandler/Examples/
Create translation file
In order to use error messages for your fields and to be able to use multilanguage labels, you have to write a translation file. We decided to make translation files kind of obligatory because it's just nicer. So if you want your form to be fully functional, we recommend to use a translation file. A little tutorial on how to use those translations is in section “How to set up multilanguage forms”.
Create a Plugin Record
Create a new page and create a content element. Choose type “General plugin”. In the section “Plugin” now choose “Formhandler” as plugin type. Now you are able to select your template file and translation file as well as setting options for e-mail sending, basic “required” error checks and a redirect page after successful submission of the form. When creating a new record, the default predefined form is selected. To add your own predefined form, you should add a new TypoScript template.
Enter your options and save.
Create a TypoScript setup
If you want to use the whole power of Formhandler you should use TypoScript to configure your form. Many different examples are available at EXT:formhandler/Examples/
Tips and tricks: It is sometimes more convenient to edit the TypoScript in an external file. This is particularly true for big typoscript chunk. To do this, insert in a suitable typoscript template (can be the root or a local TS template):
<INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE:fileadmin/templates/mailform/setup.ts">
Then, you could add this line to your user profile / group to avoid clearing the cache all the time.

Administration

Not much to say here. Have a look at the sections “Available subparts to use in the template”, “Available markers to use in subparts”, the TypoScript reference and the available error checks and you will be fine. 

For better understanding the rendering process of this extension will be explained in more detail.

How does this extension work?

The process of rendering a form got simplified to the following simple tasks:
Preprocessing:
Do some work before the form is shown, when the page is loaded for the first time (no submission took place). This can be used to load default values for fields or other tasks.
Intercepting:
Before the form is shown, there may be a need to intercept and do something with the previously entered data. Formhandler uses this for doing XSS checks. Formhandler knows two types of interceptors, InitInterceptors and SaveInterceptors. InitInterceptors are called everytime before the form is shown, SaveInterceptors are called when the form got submitted successfully right before the Finishers are called.
Validating:
After form submission there has to be a possibility to validate the input.
Finishing
After successful form submission there may be several tasks to perform, such as saving the input data to database or sending emails.

Any of these mentioned tasks can take more than one class that are called seperately.
A little example:

finishers {
  1 {
    class = Finisher_DB
    config {
    ...
    }
  }
  2 {
    class = Finisher_Mail
    config {
    ...
    }
  }
  3 {
    class = Finisher_Redirect
    config {
    ...
    }
  }
}

As you see, there are several Finishers defined, which perform different tasks. It is kind of a Finisher chain, so that any number of tasks can be performed. The first Finisher will store the submitted data into a defined database table, the second will send emails to users or administrators, the third will redirect to another page. The idea of creating chains of classes is also possible for PreProcessors, Interceptors and Validators.
Configuration
Reference

Important Note:
Formhandler requires to enter class names of components to perform different tasks.
Example:
finishers.1.class = Tx_Formhandler_Finisher_Mail

To make the usage easier, it is not needed to prefix the classes with Tx_Formhandler_ in TypoScript:
finishers.1.class = Finisher_Mail

General Options

Property:
Data type:
Description:
Default:
templateFile
String / TS object
Path to template file or template code

masterTemplateFile
String/TS object/Array
Path to master template file. See section How to use a master template for details.

Example:

#single master template
masterTemplateFile = fileadmin/templates/formmaster.html

#use a cObject
masterTemplateFile = TEXT
masterTemplateFile {
  value = fileadmin/mymastertemplate.html
}

#multiple master templates
masterTemplateFile {
  1 = fileadmin/templates/formmaster.html
  2 = fileadmin/templates/master_for_contactform.html
}

#use cObjects for multiple master templates
masterTemplateFile {
  1 = TEXT
  1.value = fileadmin/templates/formmaster.html
  2 = fileadmin/templates/master_for_contactform.html
}

langFile 
String/TS object/Array
Path to language files

Example:

#single lang file
langFile = fileadmin/lang/shared.xml

#use a cObject
langFile = TEXT
langFile.value = fileadmin/lang/shared.xml

#multiple lang files
langFile {
  1 = fileadmin/lang/shared.xml
  2 = fileadmin/lang/forms/mailformxy.xml
}

#use cObjects for multiple master templates
langFile {
  1 = TEXT
  1.value = fileadmin/lang/shared.xml
  2 = fileadmin/lang/forms/mailformxy.xml
}

additionalIncludePaths
Array
The component manager will search in paths enteres here for classes.

Example:

plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings {
  additionalIncludePaths {
    1 = fileadmin/templates/scripts
  }
}

If you use “predef” for your form, you can also use it for “additionalIncludePaths”:

plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.example {
  additionalIncludePaths {
    1 = fileadmin/templates/scripts
  }
}

NOTE: additionalIncludePaths on global level and additionalIncludePaths on predef level will be merged. So you can define include paths for all your forms and special ones for single forms.

Use this if you create your own components and don't want to create an extension for that. (See section How to use your own components for details)

cssFile
String/Array
Path to stylesheet file(s).

Example:

cssFile = fileadmin/css/forms.css

cssFile {
  1 = fileadmin/css/forms.css
  2 = fileadmin/css/contactform.css
}

jsFile
String/Array
Path to JavaScript file(s).

Example:

jsFile = fileadmin/js/jquery.js

jsFile {

}

view
String
Classname of the view to be used
Tx_Formhandler_View_Default
controller
String
Classname of the controller to be used
Tx_Formhandler_Controller_Default
formID
String
Value of the id attribute of the form tag. This is mandatory, if you use enableFileRemoval and have more than one form on a page. 

Without formID the JavaScript code to remove a file from the uploaded files list submits the first form on the page.

formValuesPrefix
String
Prefix of form fields. Use this if you use a prefix for your forms to avoid conflicts with other plugins. Settings this option you will be able to use only the fieldname in all markers and do not need to add prefix.
 
NOTE:  It is highly recommended to use this setting!    

Example:      

<input type="text" name="formhandler[email]" value="###value_email###" />
 
If you do not set formValuesPrefix, you will not be able to use the marker 
###value_email###.      

debug
Boolean (0,1)
Toggle debug mode, which will print debug messages to screen
0
disableConfigValidation
Boolean (0,1)
Formhandler will check if all needed classes are used in TypoScript for the values entered in Flexform. If you have your own components using the Flexform values, you can disable this check using disableConfigValidation = 1
0

PreProcessor_LoadDefaultValues

Prefills form fields with configured values. Config is done for each step and for each form field. If you aim to prefill dynamically a dropdown menu (e.g. from the datebase), refer to the section “How to fill your own markers via TypoScript”. There is a neat example about how to generate the “option” tags.

Example:
preProcessors {
    1.class = Tx_Formhandler_PreProcessor_LoadDefaultValues

Interceptor_Filtreatment

Removes malicious code from submitted values to prevent XSS attacks. This Interceptor is added  automatically by Formhandler. It removes malicious code and by default some characters from the input values. For a list of characters, which will be removed, have a look at the following configuration section.

You can use the removeChars setting to remove bad words or characters by entering a comma seperated list or using a cObject like USER to connect to a service.

Example:
plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.initInterceptors.1.class = Tx_Formhandler_Interceptor_Filtreatment
plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.initInterceptors.1.config.fieldConf {
	name.removeChars = %,&,/
	email.removeChars = TEXT

		# This name appears in the dropdown selector in plugin record
		name = Contact form
		...
		...
	}

4. Now you can choose the entered predefined form from the “Predefined forms” dropdown.
5. Save and view the page.
HINT: they are many examples available at EXT:formhandler/Examples
How to set up a multistep form

1. Create a HTML template file containing your form. Examples can be found in EXT:formhandler/Examples/MultiStep
2. Create a new page
3. Create an extension template and enter a TypoScript setup entering template file, lang file and other settings.
4. Create a content element with type “General Plugin”
5. Choose “Formhandler” in Dropdown “Plugin”
6. Choose “Multi step” from Dropdown “Type”
7. Save and view the page

NOTE: You can overwrite settings made in plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings for each step using plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.[stepnumber]
How to set up a multistep form with conditions

1. Create a HTML template file containing your form. Examples can be found in EXT:formhandler/Examples/MultiStepConditions
2. Create a new page
3. Create an extension template and enter a TypoScript setup entering template file, lang file and other settings.
4. Create a content element with type “General Plugin”
5. Choose “Formhandler” in Dropdown “Plugin”
6. Choose “Multi step” from Dropdown “Type”
7. Add conditions and change the settings plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.[stepnumber].templateSuffix
8. Save and view the page

How the conditions work:

plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings {
  if {
    1 {
      conditions.OR1.AND1 = field1=value1
      isTrue { 
        # Make settings for a different step 3
        3 { 
          templateSuffix = _alternative
          validators.1.config.disableErrorCheckFields = firstname,lastname,email 
        } 
      }
      else {
        # Do something if the condition was not true. This will not be needed often.
      }
    }
    2 {
      conditions.OR1 {
        AND1 = age<21
        AND2 = product=alcohol
      }
      isTrue { 
        templateSuffix = _underage
        validators.1.config.disableErrorCheckFields = firstname,lastname,email 
      }
      else {
        # Do something if the condition was not true. This will not be needed often.
      }
    }
}

Using the “if” setting you can specifiy conditions for GET/POST parameters. If the conditions evaluates to TRUE, the settings in “isTrue” will be merged with the original Formhandler settings.
The conditions can be specified in two levels. Level 1 will be OR conditions, level 2 will be AND conditions.

Example:
plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings {
  if {
    1 {
      conditions {
	  OR1 {
	    AND1 = field1=value1
	    AND2 = field2=value2
	  }
        OR2 {
          AND1 = field3=value3
        }
	}
    }
  }
}

This will result in the following condition:

(field1 == 'value1' && field2 == 'value2') || (field3 == 'value3')

You can use the following operators:
=, <, >, !=

NOTE: If you don't use an operator, Formhandler will check if the field is set in GET/POST.
NOTE: You can use the '|' operator to access values in an array like in normal TypoScript conditions.


NOTE: Using the TypoScript setting 'templateSuffix', you can define different templates for your steps, emails and PDFs. If you have a form with 3 steps and you want to send emails and PDFs according to the chosen route, you can set the templateSuffix option for step 4 too to ensure that the correct template for emails and PDFs is set.

How to set up spam protection

	      captchafield.errorCheck.1 = captcha
	    }
	  }
	}

Enable sr_freecap for your form

        	<div>
          		<label for="freecapfield">###SR_FREECAP_NOTICE###</label>
		<div class="clear"></div>
	       ###SR_FREECAP_CANT_READ###
          		<div class="clear"></div>
          		<input type="text" size="15" id="freecapfield" name="formhandler[freecapfield]" 		title="###SR_FREECAP_NOTICE###" value="">
          		###SR_FREECAP_IMAGE###
        	</div>
    	<!--###CAPTCHA_INSERT###-->
	
3. Enter error check for this field in TypoScript

	plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.validators.1 {
	  class = Tx_Formhandler_Validator_Default
	  config {
	    fieldConf {
	      freecapfield.errorCheck.1 = srFreecap
	    }
	  }
	}
	
Enable jm_recaptcha for your form

1. Make sure that the extension "jm_recaptcha" is installed
2. Register an account at http://recaptcha.net/ to get a public and a private key for your domain.
3. Enter the keys received from http://recaptcha.net/ in TypoScript:

	plugin.tx_jmrecaptcha {
	  public_key = xxx
	  private_key = xxx
	}
	
4. Add marker to template:

	###error_recaptcha_response_field###
	###RECAPTCHA###
	
5. Enter error check for this field in TypoScript

	plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.validators.1 {
	  class = Tx_Formhandler_Validator_Default
	  config {
	    fieldConf {
	      recaptcha_response_field.errorCheck.1 = jmRecpatcha
	    }
	  }
	}
	
Enable mathGuard for your form

1. Add marker to template

	###error_mathguard_answer###
	###MATHGUARD###

2. Enter error check for this field in TypoScript

	plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.validators.1 {
	  class = Tx_Formhandler_Validator_Default
	  config {
	    fieldConf {
	      mathguard_answer.errorCheck.1 = mathGuard
	    }
	  }
	}
How to set up error checks

1. Add markers like ###error_[fieldname]### to your template
2. Set up a validator in TypoScript
	
	plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.validators.1 {
	  class = Tx_Formhandler_Validator_Default
	  config {
	    fieldConf {
	      	field1 {
		 errorCheck.1 = required
		 errorCheck.2 = maxLength
		 errorCheck.2.value = 50
		}
		field2 {
		 errorCheck.1 = required
		 errorCheck.2 = email
		}
	    }
	  }
	}
3. Add entries for error messages to your translation file

    <label index="error_field1_required">Field1 is required!</label>
    <label index="error_field1_maxLength">Field1 has to be shorter than ###value### characters!</label>
    <label index="error_field2_required">Field2 is required!</label>
    <label index="error_field2_email">Field2 is no valid e-mail!</label>

NOTE: The marker ###value### in the error message is filled with the value of the parameter “value” for error check “maxLength”. If an error check requires parameters, you can use markers like ###[parametername]### in the translatable message.
When you have to validate values in nested arrays you can nest the validators as well. Given following fields:
    <input type="text" name="birthdate[day]"/>
    <input type="text" name="birthdate[month]"/>
    <input type="text" name="birthdate[year]"/>
    <input type="text" name="name"/>

You can setup your validators like that:
validators.1.config.fieldConf {
      birthdate {
        day.errorCheck {
          1 = betweenValue
          1.minValue = 1
          1.maxValue = 31
        }
        month.errorCheck {
          1 = betweenValue
          1.minValue = 1
          1.maxValue = 12
        }
        year.errorCheck {
          1 = minValue
          1.minValue = 45
        }
      }
      birthdate.errorCheck.1 = maxItems
      birthdate.errorCheck.1.value = 3
      name.errorCheck.1 = required
    }

The errors for the birthdate array will then be merged into the marker ###error_birthdate###.
How to use ###is_error### markers

These markers allow you to display additional content is an error occurred for each form field or globally.

In your HTML template you can add these markers:
###is_error###
###is_error_[fieldname]###

Formhandler will search for content to replace these markers in the translation file and in the TypoScript setup.
In the translation file enter the values like:
<label index="is_error_field1">Error occurred in field1!</label>

or enter a default message for all fields:
<label index="is_error_default">Error occurred!</label>

or enter a global message used for the marker ###is_error###:
<label index="is_error">Error occurred!</label>


A possible TypoScript configuration looks like this:

plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings {
  isErrorMarker {
    global = Global message if an error occurred (filled into ###is_error###)
    default = class=”error” (filled into ###is_error_[fieldname]###
    field1 = TEXT
    field1.value = Some message (filled into ###is_error_field1###)
  }
}

Example:
###error_firstname###
<div class=”row” ###is_error_firstname###>
  <label for=”firstname”>###LLL:firstname###</label>
  <input type=”text” name=”formhandler[firstname]” value=”###value_firstname”  />
</div>

Using this you can display an error message like “Firstname is missing” and add a CSS class to the surrounding DIV to highlight the row containing the error.
How to fill your own markers via TypoScript

Coding 1: 
1. Add the marker into your template

	###myMarker###

2. Register the marker in TypoScript. (3 examples available)

      plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.myForm.markers.myMarker_1 = TEXT
      plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.myForm.markers.myMarker_1.value = My marker content

      # getText function
      plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.myForm.markers.myMarker_2 = TEXT
      plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.myForm.markers.myMarker_2.data = getIndpEnv:HTTP_HOST 

      # Constant insertion
      plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.myForm.markers.myMarker_3 = TEXT
      plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.predef.myForm.markers.myMarker_3.value = {$local.myConstant}


3. The marker will be filled with “My marker content”

NOTE: You can fill your own markers using any TypoScript object like USER or COA. Just try it out.

Coding 2: Prefill a drop down menu dynamically

1. Let's say you have dropdown menu in your HTML template which you may want to generate dynamically.
<select id="changeMe" name="changeMe">
  <option value="">###LLL:selectValue###</option>
  ###options_dropdown###
</select>
2. Next, you will need to write / adapt the following TypoScript
options_dropdown = CONTENT
options_dropdown{
   table = tx_addresses_domain_model_address
   select {
       pidInList = 1
       orderBy = last_name
       selectFields = uid, first_name, last_name
       # possible conditions
       # where = ( tx_mytable.type='b0' OR tx_mytablet.type='b1' )
   }
   
   renderObj = COA
   renderObj {
       
       #value
       10.wrap = <option value="|" 
       10 = TEXT
       10.field = uid
       
       #selected
       12.noTrimWrap = | ###selected_mytable_|###>|
       12 = TEXT
       12.field = uid
       
       #label
       13 = TEXT
       13.wrap = |</option>
       13.field = first_name
   }
}


How to hide unfilled form field values in templates

In your HTML-Template you are able to wrap the field output in e-mails and subpart ###TEMPLATE_SUBMITTEDOK### with a subpart:
<!-- ###ISSET_fax### -->
  ###value_fax###<br/>
<!-- ###ISSET_fax### -->
If the user filled out the field “fax” in the form, the text will get shown in the e-mails, otherwise it will not be added.
You have the possibility to add some conditions:
<!-- ###ISSET_fax&&phone### -->
  ###value_fax###<br/>
<!-- ###ISSET_fax&&phone### -->
<!-- ###ISSET_fax&&!phone### -->
  ###fax###<br/>
<!-- ###ISSET_fax&&!phone### -->
<!-- ###ISSET_fax||phone### -->
  ###fax###<br/>
<!-- ###ISSET_fax||phone### -->

As you see, you can use the operators (&&,||,!) to do some simple checks.

NOTE: The case of the fieldname in ISSET subpart and marker MUST match.

good:

<!-- ###ISSET_EMAIL### -->
###value_EMAIL###
<!-- ###ISSET_EMAIL### -->
<!-- ###ISSET_email### -->
###value _email###
<!-- ###ISSET_email### -->

bad:

<!-- ###ISSET_EMAIL### -->
###value _email###
<!-- ###ISSET_EMAIL### -->
<!-- ###ISSET_email### -->
###value _EMAIL###
<!-- ###ISSET_email### -->

How to set up multi language forms

In the template file:
Specify markers for the multi language texts.
example:
<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM### begin -->
<form name="form" method="post" action="###REL_URL###">
<input type="hidden" name="submitted" value="1">

<table>
<tr>
<td>###LLL:username###</td>
<td><input type="text" name="username" value="###value_username###"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>###LLL:password###</td>
<td><input type="password" name="password" value="###value_password###"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=”2”><input type="submit" name="submit" value="###LLL:submit###"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</form>
<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM### end -->

Your custom language file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<T3locallang>
	<meta type="array">
		<description>Language labels for my form</description>
	</meta>
	<data type="array">
		<languageKey index="default" type="array">
			<label index="username">Username:</label>
			<label index="password">Password:</label>
			<label index="submit">Login</label>
		</languageKey>
		<languageKey index="de" type="array">
			<label index="username">Benutzername:</label>
			<label index="password">Passwort:</label>
			<label index="submit">Anmelden</label>
		</languageKey>
	</data>
</T3locallang>

TypoScript:

You can specifiy the path to your translation file in any setting “langFile” associated with “formhandler”.
Example:
plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.langFile = fileadmin/lang/myLangFile.xml

How to load data from DB to use in Finisher_DB
It may be useful to extend the set of data submitted in the form before inserting them in the database. You may want to fetch additional data from the database, the session, the GET / POST parameters or from something else. This can be done quite easily since the key "mapping" can understand TypoScript.
Let's have a look at the following lines. They are 4 examples, field_demo_1, field_demo_2, field_demo_3, field_demo_4.
2.class = Tx_Formhandler_Finisher_DB
2.config {
    table = tt_content
    key = uid
    fields {

        # Retrieves data from the GET / POST parameters
        field_demo_1 {
            mapping = TEXT
            mapping.data = GPvar:formhandler|firstname
        }

        # Retrieves data from the database
        field_demo_2 {
            mapping = TEXT
            mapping {
                dataWrap = DB:tx_cuso_courses:{GPvar:formhandler|course_uid}:title
                insertData = 1
                wrap3 = {|}
            }
        }

        # Retrieves data from the session
        field_demo_3 {
            mapping = TEXT
            mapping.data = TSFE:fe_user|user|last_name
        }

        # Some more cool stuff
        field_demo_4 {
            mapping = COA
            mapping {
                 10 = TEXT
                 10 {
                     data = GPvar:formhandler|firstname
                 }
                 20 = TEXT
                 20 {
                     data = GPvar:formhandler|lastname
                     noTrimWrap = | |: |
                 }
                 30 = TEXT
                 30 {
                    dataWrap = DB:tx_cuso_courses:{GPvar:formhandler|course_uid}:title
                    insertData = 1
                    wrap3 = {|}
                 }
            }
        }
    }
}
How to store data into more than one DB table
To store data into different tables you have to chain different Finisher_DBs. You can use the setting special to access the uid of a previously inserted record.

finishers {
    1.class = Finisher_DB
    1.config {
      table = fe_users
      fields {
      	username.mapping = lastname
     }
    }
    2.class = Finisher_DB
    2.config {
      table = tt_address
      fields {
      	pid.special = inserted_uid
      	pid.special.table = fe_users
      	email.mapping = email
      	first_name.mapping = firstname
      	last_name.mapping = lastname
     }
    }
}

The first Finisher_DB stores data into the table fe_users. The second one create a record in the child table tt_address. The pid field of this record is set to the uid of the inserted record in fe_users.

How to use your own controller

This is for advanced users only!
If you want to write your own controller make sure it inherits from Tx_Formhandler_AbstractController.
You can set your controller using TypoScript:
tt_content.list.20.formhandler_pi1.controller = Tx_MyExt_MyController

NOTE: Your custom controller file (in this case: Tx_MyExt_MyController.php) has to be located in a directory 'Classes' in your extension. Otherwise it will not be found by the component manager! (EXT:myext/Classes/Tx_MyExt_MyController.php)

How to use your own component (Interceptor, Finisher, ...)

This is for advanced users only!
There are two ways to integrate your own component.
1. Using an extension:
- Create a new extension (Example: myext)
- Create a folder 'Classes' and put your components in there.
Example:
myext/Classes/Finisher/Tx_MyExt_Finisher_MyFinisher.php
- Make sure your class extends the abstract base class (Example: Tx_Formhandler_AbstractFinisher)
- Use your class in TypoScript.
Example: finishers.1.class = Tx_MyExt_Finisher_MyFinisher
2. Using additional include paths
- Create your class somewhere (Example: fileadmin/scripts/Tx_Formhandler_Finisher_MyFinisher.php)
- Make sure the class name starts with Tx_Formhandler
- Make sure your class extends the abstract base class (Example: Tx_Formhandler_AbstractFinisher)
- Enter the path in TypoScript:
Example: plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings.additionalIncludePaths.1 = fileadmin/scripts/
- Use your class in TypoScript.
Example: finishers.1.class = Tx_MyExt_Finisher_MyFinisher

How to XCLASS Formhandler

Formhandler doesn't use the default pibase architecture. Therefore there is no possibility to change Formhandler's behaviour by Xclassing. But since Formhandler is structured in different classes, you can simply extend an existing class (e.g. Finisher_DB) to satisfy your needs and enter your class name in TypoScript.
Example:

class Finisher_Extended extends Finisher_DB {
	public function process() {
		...do something else than the default Finisher_DB
	}
}

TypoScript:
finishers.2 {
  class = Finisher_Extended
  config {
    …
  }
}
How to use a master template

Master templates can be used to define a structure for your form fields or email templates. You can add the fields to your template by simply using a marker.

Example:
Master template:

<!-- ###field_input### --> 
###error_###fieldname###### 
<label for="###fieldname###">###LLL:###fieldname######</label> 
<input type="text" name="###fieldname###" id="###fieldname###" value="###value_###fieldname######" /> 

<!-- ###field_input### --> 

<!-- ###field_submit### --> 
###LLL:label_submit### 
<input type="submit" ###submit_nextStep### value="Abschicken" /> 
 <!-- ###field_submit### →

As you can see, there are two subparts containing the structure for an input field and the submit button.
Each subpart must begin with either “field_” or “master_” the rest is freely choosable.
In your HTML template you can simply add a marker referring to this subpart plus entering a fieldname as suffix:

<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM1### --> 
<form action="###rel_url###"> 
	<input type="hidden" name="formhandler[submitted]" value="1"/> 
	<input type="hidden" name="id" value="###pid###" /> 
	###field_input_name### 
	###field_submit### 
</form> 
<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM1### -->

The marker ###field_input_name### refers to the subpart ###field_input###. The additional “_name” is the value to replace the ###fieldname### markers with. If you don't add this suffix, the marker ###fieldname### doesn't get replaced (as in ###field_submit###).
The replaced HTML will look like this:
<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM1### --> 
<form action="###rel_url###"> 
	<input type="hidden" name="formhandler[submitted]" value="1"/> 
	<input type="hidden" name="id" value="###pid###" /> 
	###error_name### 
	<label for="name">###LLL:name###</label> 
	<input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="###value_name###" /> 
	###LLL:label_submit### 
	<input type="submit" ###submit_nextStep### value="Abschicken" /> 
</form> 
<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM1### -->

Using the master template you can predefine HTML for fields and manage it in a single file. You can import the subpart to your HTML template as often as you want.

NOTE: If you use multiple master templates equally named subparts will be overriden by the last master template containing the subpart!

How to use AJAX validation
To validate each field just after the user clicked outside it, you first have to add an AjaxHandler to your TypoScript:
plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings {

  ajax {
    class = Tx_Formhandler_AjaxHandler_JQuery
    config { 
	notOk = <span class="notok">&nbsp;</span> 
	ok = <span class="ok">&nbsp;</span> 
	initial = <span class="###is_error_###fieldname######">&nbsp;</span> 
	loading = <img src="fileadmin/templates/images/loader.gif" /> 
    }
  }
}

The handler in this example will use the jQuery framework (www.jquery.com). 
As you can see, you can specify the initial content, the content while loading and the content if the check was OK/not OK via TypoScript. This content will be inserted in markers like ###validate_[fieldname]###.
Example:
<label for="contact_name">###LLL:label_name######required_name###</label><br /> 
<input class="input" id="contact_name" type="text" name="contact[name]" value="###value_name###" /> 
###validate_name###

The AJAX validation will use the error checks defined in the “fieldConf” section of Tx_Formhandler_Validator_Default.

How to upgrade from th_mailformplus to Formhandler

There are many forms out there which use th_mailformplus. If you ask yourself, what would happen if you did an update to Formhandler, here is a short explanation on how to change the TypoScript of th_mailformplus to work with MailformplusMVC. This is not a complete tutorial, it only shows the basic differences. Many of the TypoScript settings are named equally, but some also have changed, were removed or didn't exist in th_mailformplus.

TypoScript:
A TypoScript setup for th_mailformplus may look like this:

plugin.tx_thmailformplus_pi1 {
	langFile = typo3conf/ext/th_mailformplus/example_form/singlepage_forms/improved_demo_lang.php

	default {
		email_to = admin@host.com
		email_sendtouser = email
		email_subject_user = Your contact request
		email_sender = noreply@host.com
	}

	fieldConf {
		name {
			errorCheck = required
		}
		email {
			errorCheck = required,email
		}
		text {
			errorCheck = required
		}
	}
}

In this configuration a translation file is included, error checks are defined and settings for email sending to an admin and the user are made.
The same configuration with Formhandler will look this way:
plugin.Tx_Formhandler.settings {
	langFile = typo3conf/ext/th_mailformplus/example_form/singlepage_forms/improved_demo_lang.php

	validators.1.class = Validator_Default
	validators.1.config.fieldConf {
		name {
			errorCheck.1 = required
		}
		email {
			errorCheck.1 = required
			errorCheck.2 = email
		}
		text {
			errorCheck.1 = required
		}
	}
	
	finishers.1.class = FinisherMail
	finishers.1.config {
		admin {
			to_email = admin@host.com
			sender_email = noreply@host.com
		}
		user {
			to_email = email
			sender_email = noreply@host.com
			subject = Your contact request
		}
	}
}

As you see, the configuration looks similar, but Formhandler uses blocks like “validators” or “finishers” to make it possible to group any number of classes. So that it is possible to let “finishers.1” be a class to send emails and “finishers.2” be a class to store data into database. 
When you compare the TypoScript options of th_mailformplus with Formhandler you will find out that they are quite similar and you should have no problems with writing configuration for Formhandler if you knew th_mailformplus before.

HTML:

Upgrading the HTML from th_mailformplus to Formhandler is easier than you might think.
Formhandler uses nearly the same markers and subparts as th_mailformplus.
Have a look at this th_mailformplus HTML template for a simple contact form:

<-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM### begin -->
<div class="mailformplus_contactform">
###ERROR###
<form name="contact_form" method="post" action="###REL_URL###">
	<input type="hidden" name="id" value="###PID###" />
	<input type="hidden" name="submitted" value="1" />
	<input type="hidden" name="L" value="###value_L###" />
	<input type="hidden" name="type" value="###value_type###" />
	<div>
		<label for="name">###LLL:name######required_name###</label>
		<input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="###value_name###"/>
		<br/>
		<label for="subject">###LLL:subject###</label>
		<input type="text" name="subject" id="subject" value="###value_subject###"/>
		<br/>
		<label for="email">###LLL:email######required_name###</label>
		<input type="text" name="email" id="email" value="###value_email###"/>
		<br/>
		<label for="phone">###LLL:phone###</label>
		<input type="text" name="phone" id="phone" value="###value_phone###"/>
		<br/>
		<label for="text">###LLL:text######required_name###</label>
		<textarea cols="50" rows="5" name="text" id="text">###value_text###</textarea>
		<br/>
		<div class="caption">###LLL:contact_via###</div>
		<input type="radio" name="contact_via" value="email" id="contact_email"  ###checked_contact_via_email### /><label for="contact_email">###LLL:contact_via_email###</label><br />
		<input type="radio" name="contact_via" value="phone" id="contact_phone" ###checked_contact_via_phone### /><label for="contact_phone">###LLL:contact_via_phone###</label>
		<br/>
		<p>###LLL:required_fields###</p>
		<input type="submit" value="###LLL:submit###"/>
	</div>
</form>
</div>
<!-- ###TEMPLATE_FORM### end -->

Now we take this template and make it compatible with Formhandler.
The changes will be:
Change subpart to ###TEMPLATE_FORM1###
Add ###submit_nextStep### to submit button
You can remove all the hidden fields on top of your form. Formhandler will add them for you automatically. If you want to control the position of the hidden fields, you can use the marker ###HIDDEN_FIELDS### in your template.
Rename subpart ###TEMPLATE_SUBMITTED_OK### to ###TEMPLATE_SUBMITTEDOK###, if you use it.
E-Mail subparts are now named:
###TEMPLATE_EMAIL_USER_PLAIN###
###TEMPLATE_EMAIL_USER_HTML###
###TEMPLATE_EMAIL_ADMIN_PLAIN###
###TEMPLATE_EMAIL_ADMIN_HTML###

No more changes are required. All other markers are exactly the same in Formhandler.
###value_[fieldname]###
###error_[fieldname]###
###LLL:[key]###
###required_[fieldname]###
###checked_[fieldname]_[fieldvalue]###
###selected_[fieldname]_[fieldvalue]###
Known problems
When using AJAX remove links for uploaded files the file markers such as ###[fieldname]_fileCount### do not get updated because the request only refreshes the content of the marker ###[fieldname]_uploadedFiles###. A possible solution would be to reload the whole form using the AJAX request.

To-Do list
Add a 1-2-3 wizard to generate form templates, translation files and TypoScript setup code.
Think about integration of “extBase” architecture and usage of Fluid.
